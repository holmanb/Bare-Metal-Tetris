# LED Matrix Games

This repository currently includes a tetris game that can be compiled and and loaded to the FRDM-KL25Z using Keil uVision5.
Some assembly is required to get started, so a (better) schematic will be coming soon.

Specifications:
* Dev Board: FRDM-KL25Z                 | can be purchased from [NXP](http://www.nxp.com/products/software-and-tools/hardware-development-tools/freedom-development-boards/freedom-development-platform-for-kinetis-kl14-kl15-kl24-kl25-mcus:FRDM-KL25Z)     
* Display:   16x32 RGB LED matrix panel | can be purchased from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/420)
* Miscellaneous: Requires a breadboard and some jumper wires and pushbuttons for user input. 



Future
==============
* Improve hardware and user controls
* Complete the Tetris Game
* Add other arcade games (possibly: pong, defender, ateroids, etc )
* Design a 3D printable hard case for the gaming system.
